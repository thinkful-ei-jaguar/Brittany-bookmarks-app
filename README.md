Bookmark App by Brittany Saucedo allowing users to create, view links to & descriptions of, view ratings of,
and delete their own bookmarks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Users can see a list of their bookmarks when they first open the app.

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating, and users can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link, and users can remove bookmarks from their bookmark list.

Users receive appropriate feedback when they cannot submit a bookmark. 

Users can select from a dropdown a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: For some reason, my FontAwesome icons, which showed the initial star ratings for each bookmark are not showing up on the LIVE site.
